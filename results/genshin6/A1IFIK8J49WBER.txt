A lot of quality damage, pausing and blurring of a video will make me skip watching any more of the video. If the video is good or excellent I watch all of the video. If the video were graded as fair for me personally it depends on how often the video pauses or skips, if it isn't much I will usually continue but if the quality isn't that great I usually just end up skipping it. I didn't have any issue understanding the grading or guidelines.
