It's annoying to watch the damaged quality because it takes you out of the moment and it makes you frustrated by seeing it. I don't like to feel frustrated while I'm trying to be entertained. When the glitching happens and the quality kind of skips around or freezes it's very annoying and it feels like you missed something.
