Thinking of previous hits I've done  for you regarding video gaming, I find decreases in bit depth and stalling less annoying on these current videos because it would not affect any sort of game play. It moderately reduces the enjoyment of the video but not dramatically. I also wanted to note that I actually find stalling on this type of video less of a problem than decreases in bit depth, unlike on video game play videos. Stall can cause you to lose a game; on these dog videos it has less of a degrading effect than the decrease in bit depth, but again, only moderately so.
