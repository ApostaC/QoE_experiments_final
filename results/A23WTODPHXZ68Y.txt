Everything is explained perfectly. A little bit of the bitrate stuff annoys me, but not so much that I will click out and not play or watch. Stalling is infuriating if it happens continuley. Actually, both are infuriating if they happen continuily. Stalling sometimes confuses me. Is it MY computer? If it happens once, I'm fine as long as it is not extended seconds. But then I think, is it over? I will rewind if a video to see if it was just a fluke. Then I wonder if I missed something. Overall, as long as it is not excessive. Meaning more than once or twice, it typlically doesn't bother me and I move on. However, I do wonder about the quality of the video once I figure out it is not happening on my end.
